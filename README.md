# testprojectrepny // The Children of Hurin
## First attempt at playing with a storyboard tool called Ren'Py
##### Because I'm a massive nerd I've chosen to do parts of The Children of Hurin written by JRR Tolkien
##### I have chosen to use Ren'Py as it enables me to brush off some rust (I haven't used Python for a good 10 years)

### Handy command for me because for some reason my IDE doesn't want to pickup automatically all files that belong to this repo/project
### git add * && git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE HERE" && git push

# testprojectrepny
## First attempt at playing with a storyboard tool called Ren'Py
### Because I'm a massive nerd I've chosen to do parts of The Children of Hurin written by JRR Tolkien

### Handy command for me because for some reason my IDE doesn't want to pickup automatically all files that belong to this repo/project
### git add * && git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE HERE" && git push
